# NgModuleApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

Angular NgModule:

declarations: This array is used to declare the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module. In your case, AppComponent, FooterComponent, and HeaderComponent are declared here. This means they are part of this module and can be used within it.

imports: This array is used to import other Angular modules that are required by this module. In your example, BrowserModule (which is necessary for running the app in a web browser) and AppRoutingModule (which handles routing in your application) are imported.

providers: This array is used to register services that the module will use. Services are typically singleton objects that provide functionality that can be shared across the entire application. In your current configuration, it's empty, meaning there are no services registered at the moment.

bootstrap: This array lists the main application view or root component that Angular should bootstrap when starting the application. Here, AppComponent is specified as the root component, which means it's the entry point of your application.
